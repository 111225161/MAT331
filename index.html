<p> TuTh  11:30-12:50   Math Tower S-235S (computer lab in basement) <p>

<h2>  Final Exam: Tuesday, May 15, 11:15am-1:45pm</h2>
<h2>  Final Exam Location: TBA </h2>



<p>
This is a course in problem solving using Python 3.6 and iPython
</p> 


<h2> Grades </h2>

<p>
Grades will be based on: <br>
(1) In-class quizzes.   <br>
(2) Homework.  These will be two kinds of homework: 
     written homeworks, usually involving mathematical proves and 
     calculation by hands. 
     programming homeworks, usually involving 
    writing a short report stating the problem, describing how 
    to solve it, giving the Python/iPython code you used, and table or pictures 
    that illustrate your results.  <br>
(3) Projects: Throughout the semester, each of your python codes will contibute to a portion of a final project.  <br>
(4) Final exam (similar to quizzes, but longer) <br> 
</p>

<p>
During the last week of class I will post tentative grades based on 
the homework, quizes (best 4 or 5) and two projects.  A percent will 
be compute for each of the three categories and the average of these
three numbers taken. The letter grade will be based on this average.
You will receive at least this grade for the class. 
If you are happy with this grade, then you need not hand in a
 third project or take the final. If you 
would like to improve the tentative grade then you can hand in 
a third project and take the final. Then your grade will be 
based on the average of the percents for homework, quizes (best 4 of 5), 
projects and the final (each of the four categories counts equally). 
</p>

 Histogram </a>  of over totals as of Nov 20, 2017. This includes the 
3 homeworks, the best 4 out of 5 quizes, and Project 1. Each category 
was converted into a percentage (out of 100) and then I took the avergage 
of these (all weighted equally).

<h2>   Class Projects  </h2>

<p>  Projects are longer versions of the homework assigments, but I 
will give several and you need to choose any three to hand in. If 
you are enrolled in MAT 459, then two of these can be used to 
satisfy the university WRDT requirement, as described above. <br><br>

The first project is due October 31, the second  November  30 and the 
third 0n Decemeber 7 (last day of class). 
You may submit eithe a hardcopy
or electronic version (but I would prefer a hardcopy to make sure 
it is printed just as you intend).  <br><br>

Each listed project has two components for you to look at. 
The first is a one page description 
of what I want you to do. This will  often include an itemized list of 
computations I want you to make, based on the reading the second 
part.  The second will usually be a some 
notes written by myself, or a  short recent paper by some mathematician
describing a calculation or algorithm.   Usually there will be more material 
here than you need to do the project; I generally only want you to do 
and describe experiments that test the claims of the paper, and you generally 
don't have to understand the proofs in the paper to do this.

<h3> How to write up the projects </h3> 
<p>
 The write-up is supposed to be a short report that 
explains what the problem is and how you solved it, 
including any samples of code or output (such as tables
or plots). Think of it like an essay for an English or 
History class except that it is written about a math problem,
instead of about Jane Austin or the French revolution. There 
should be an introduction that describes the problem, a 
main body that gives the details of your solution and a 
conclusion the briefly summarizes your results. <br><br>

Some good things to do include:<br> 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Put titles on your plots  <br> 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Insert comments into code saying what role
named arrays play and what loops are doing  <br> 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  supress intermediate calculations and 
   display a single table of results at end 
          <br> 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; when  comparing two or more arrays, present 
    them as columns of a single table/array  <br> 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  when plotting an approximation to a function, 
   also plot the function so we can see how close they are.  Also 
consider plotting (separately) the difference of the two.   <br> 

</p>

<br>
<h3> Re-do project 1 </h3>  I will allow students who scored less 
than 90 on the first project to hand in a revision for re-grading 
by Tuesday, Nov 14. There will not be a similar opportunity for the 
second and third projects.
